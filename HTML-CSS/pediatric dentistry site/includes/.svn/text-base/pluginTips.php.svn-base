			<h3>Teething... What should be expected</h3>
			<p>Teething is a natural process where primary (baby) teeth grow through the gum tissue into the mouth. Many times this process is preceded by discomfort, fever, drooling, and the child chewing on anything within reach. Once the teeth push through the gum tissue, the discomfort usually subsides. Treat with Ambesol®/Orajel®; or if a low grade fever persists use Children's Tylenol®.</p>

			<h3>Chipped teeth happen but they should be treated</h3>
			<p>Fractured or chipped teeth are fairly common occurrences. Fractures/chips often occur as a result of trauma or due to weakness in the tooth. If your child fractures their tooth, you should contact us for an appointment to evaluate the extent of the injury. When fractured, most teeth can be restored using a white filling material. If a tooth is fractured exposing the nerve, we sometimes place a medicine over the exposed area to help promote the recovery and healing of the nerve tissue.</p>

			<h3>Halitosis (bad breath) treatments and prevention</h3>
			<p>The most common factor of bad breath/halitosis in children is bacteria. People have millions of bacteria throughout their mouth and many of those bacteria emit a foul smell when they over populate. To help reduce the amount of the bacteria it is important to brush the tongue, floss, and try to incorporate a mouthwash into the daily routine.</p>

			<h3>Grinding teeth is expected in young children</h3>
			<p>Night bruxism (grinding) is very common in children, especially prior to the eruption of the permanent first molars. Some children will show signs of this wear on their teeth but usually there is very little sensitivity with these teeth. We do not typically create night-guards to wear for grinding since the habit will most likely depart within a couple of years.</p>

			<h3>Diet effects the development of your child's teeth</h3>
			<p>Diet is a very important aspect in dental health. Children with high sugar or carbohydrate diets are at greater risk for developing cavities. In addition frequent eating or snacking throughout the day will increase the risk for cavities as well. Help your child choose healthy low sugar natural snacks and set up a daily routine for their meals and snacks. This will help provide you the good defense against developing dental decay.</p>

			<h3>Loose teeth should be wiggled out</h3>
			<p>At some point every child will experience having a loose tooth. Primary teeth usually exfoliate (fall out) between the ages of 5 to 13. When a primary (baby) tooth becomes loose due to the normal eruption of the permanent molar we like to encourage our patients to "wiggle" on those baby teeth. Wiggling helps with the loss of the tooth while the gum tissue is healthy and many times causes the tooth to fall out with minimal bleeding or discomfort. If the tooth is loose due to an injury please contact our office so we can evaluate the extent of the injury.</p>

			<h3>Thumb sucking... How to break the habit</h3>
			<p>Thumb sucking is a normal developmental process for infants and young children. The habit many times will stop without help around age 3, but sometimes it is a difficult habit to break. Children who continue this habit usually do it to relax, beat boredom, or fall asleep. If your child has not dropped the habit by age 5, stay positive and try discussing it with them. Another option is to place a bandage (band-aid) on their thumb, this may change the sensation the child receives from thumb sucking. Avoid using a bad tasting liquid to prevent thumb sucking, depending on what is used, this method may not be safe for your child.</p>

			<h3>Your child's first tooth</h3>
			<p>Tooth eruption is the process where a developed tooth grows into the mouth. Tooth erruption can occur as early as 3 or 4 months of age. This development is usually associated with a low grade fever, discomfort, excess drooling, and many children will constantly place their hands in their mouths for comfort. It usually takes a few weeks for a tooth to erupt and using Children's Tylenol® or Motrin® can help ease discomfort.</p>

			<h3>Wisdom teeth commonly need to be removed</h3>
			<p>Wisdom teeth are the final set of molars that form in the jaw. We typically see wisdom teeth in radiographs (x-rays) and they are usually removed between the ages of 15 and 18. Most wisdom teeth are impacted; caused by the tooth having an improper position that does not allow for eruption. Impaction can be a very painful issue and should be addressed by the dentist as soon as possible.</p>
