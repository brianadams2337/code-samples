	<h2>Sedation</h2>
	<p>Sedation is a technique to guide a child’s behavior during dental treatment. Medications are used to help increase cooperation and to reduce anxiety or discomfort associated with dental procedures. Sedative medications cause most children to become relaxed and drowsy. Unlike general anesthesia, sedation is not intended to make a patient unconscious or unresponsive.</p>

	<h3>Should my child be sedated for dental treatment?</h3>
	<div class="columns">
	<p>Not necessarily. Sedation may be indicated for children who have a level of anxiety that prevents good coping skills, those who are very young and do not understand how to cope in a cooperative fashion, or those requiring extensive dental treatment. Sedation can also be helpful for some patients who have special needs.</p>

	<h3>Are there any instructions to follow before a sedation appointment?</h3>
	<div class="columns">
	<p>Children often perceive a parent’s anxiety which makes them more fearful. They tolerate procedures best when their parents understand what to expect and prepare them for the experience. If you have any questions about the sedation process, please ask. As you become more confident, so will your child.</p>
	<p>Should your child become ill, contact us to see if it is necessary to postpone the appointment. Be sure to inform us about any prescribed, over-the-counter, or herbal medications your child is taking. Check with your Dr. Thiel to see if routine medications should be taken the day of the sedation.</p>
	<p>We will provide you with additional detailed instructions before your sedation visit. It is very important to follow the directions regarding fasting from fluids and foods prior to the sedation appointment.</p>

	<h3>Are there any instructions to follow after the sedation appointment?</h3>
	<div class="columns">
	<p>Dr. Thiel will evaluate your child’s health status and discharge your child when he or she is responsive, stable, and ready to go. Children recover from the effects of sedatives at different rates so be prepared to remain at the office until the after-effects are minimal. Once home, your child must remain under adult supervision until fully recovered from the effects of the sedation. We will discuss specific post-sedation instructions with you, including appropriate diet and physical activity.</p>
