	<h2>Fluoride Treatments</h2>
	<p>Topical application applied directly to the teeth to provide protection to the tooth from dental decay; this treatment is recommended twice a year directly after the dental cleaning/prophylaxis.</p>

	<h3>What are the benefits?</h3>
	<div class="columns">
	<p>The use of fluoride, both in systemic dosages and topical applications, is recommended by the American Dental Association, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, the American Academy of Pediatric Medicine, the National Institutes of Health and every dental school in the United States. Fluoride combats tooth decay in two ways.</p>
	<p>It is incorporated into the structure of developing teeth when it is ingested and also works when it comes in contact with the surface of the teeth. Fluoride prevents the acid produced by the bacteria in plaque from dissolving or demineralizing tooth enamel, the hard and shiny substance that protects the teeth. Fluoride also allows teeth damaged by acid to repair or remineralize themselves. Fluoride cannot repair cavities, but it can reverse low levels of tooth decay and thus prevent new cavities from forming. If your child is not getting enough fluoride internally through water (especially if the fluoride level is deficient or if your child drinks bottled water without fluoride), then fluoride supplements might need to be prescribed.</p>

	<h3>Is it safe for my child?</h3>
	<div class="columns">
	<p>Dr. Thiel considers many factors before recommending a fluoride supplement. Your child’s age, risk of developing dental decay, and dietary sources of fluoride are important considerations. Infant formulas contain different amounts of fluoride. Bottled, filtered, and well waters also vary in the amount of fluoride they contain. Dr. Thiel can help determine if your child is receiving — and not exceeding — the recommended amount.</p>
	<p>Using fluoride for the prevention and control of decay is proven to be both safe and effective. Nevertheless, products containing fluoride should be stored out of the reach of young children. Too much fluoride could cause fluorosis of developing permanent teeth. Fluorosis usually is mild, with tiny white specks or streaks that often are unnoticeable. In severe cases of fluorosis, the enamel may be pitted with brown discoloration. Development of fluorosis depends on the amount, duration, and timing of excessive fluoride intake. The appearance of teeth affected by fluorosis can be greatly improved by a variety of treatments in esthetic dentistry.</p>
