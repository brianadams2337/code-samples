				<h2>X-Rays</h2>
				<p>The process of taking images (with low radiation and a special lead apron to reduce exposure) of your child's teeth’s subsurface to help identify problems that are not externally visible; allowing treatment to occur for problems before problems become serious.</p>

				<h3>How often should my child have dental X-Rays?</h3>
				<div class="columns">
					<p>Since every child is unique, the need for dental X-Rays films varies from child to child. Films are taken only after reviewing your child’s medical and dental histories, performing a clinical examination, and only when they are likely to yield information that a visual examination cannot.</p>
					<p>In general, children need X-rays more often than adults. Their mouths grow and change rapidly and they are more susceptible than adults to tooth decay. For children with a high risk of tooth decay, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends X-Ray examinations every six months to detect cavities developing between the teeth. Children with a low risk of tooth decay require X-rays less frequently.</p>

				<h3>Why should X-Rays be taken if my child has never had a cavity?</h3>
				<div class="columns">
					<p>X-Ray films detect much more than cavities. For example, X-Rays may be needed to survey erupting teeth, diagnose bone diseases, evaluate the results of an injury, or plan orthodontic treatment. X-Rays allow Dr. Thiel to diagnose and treat conditions that cannot be detected during a clinical examination. If dental problems are found and treated early, dental care is more comfortable and affordable.</p>

				<h3>What safeguards are used to protect my child during X-Rays?</h3>
				<div class="columns">
					<p>Lead body aprons and shields help protect your child. Today’s equipment filters out unnecessary X-Rays and restricts the X-Ray beam to the area of interest. High-speed film, digital X-Rays, and proper shielding assure that your child receives a minimal amount of radiation exposure.</p>
