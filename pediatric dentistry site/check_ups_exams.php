				<h3>How often should my child visit the dentist?</h3>
				<div class="columns">
					<p>The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends a dental check-up at least twice a year for most children. Some children need more frequent dental visits because of increased risk of tooth decay, unusual growth patterns, or poor oral hygiene. Dr. Thiel will let you know the best appointment schedule for your child.</p>

				<h3>Why visit twice a year when my child has never had a cavity?</h3>
				<div class="columns">
					<p>Regular dental visits help your child stay cavity-free. Teeth cleanings remove debris that build up on the teeth, irritate the gums, and cause decay. Fluoride treatments renew the fluoride content in the enamel, strengthening teeth and preventing cavities. Hygiene instructions improve your child's brushing and flossing, leading to cleaner teeth and healthier gums.</p>
					<p>Tooth decay isn't the only reason for a dental visit. Dr. Thiel will provide an ongoing assessment of changes in your child's oral health. For example, your child may need additional fluoride, dietary changes, or sealants for ideal dental health. We may also identify orthodontic problems and suggest treatment to guide the teeth as they emerge in the mouth.</p>
