	<h2>Tooth Extractions</h2>
	<p>Generally, unless we are are discussing Wisdom Teeth, we would rather not extract a tooth from your child. However, it can be required when a tooth is not lost naturally or if dental decay or trauma results in an infection surrounding the root surface.</p>

	<h3>Does everyone have their Wisdom Teeth removed?</h3>
	<div class="columns">
	<p>No, not everyone has them removed but it is extremely common.</p>
	<p>Wisdom teeth are the third and final set of molars that most people get in their late teens or early twenties. Sometimes these teeth can be a valuable asset to the mouth when healthy and properly aligned, but more often, they are misaligned and require removal.</p>
	<p>Wisdom teeth present potential problems when they are misaligned â€” they can position themselves horizontally, be angled toward or away from the second molars, or be angled inward or outward. Poor alignment of wisdom teeth can crowd or damage adjacent teeth, the jawbone, or nerves. Wisdom teeth that lean toward the second molars make those teeth more vulnerable to decay by entrapping plaque and debris. In addition, wisdom teeth can be entrapped completely within the soft tissue and/or the jawbone or only partially erupt through the gum. Teeth that remain partially or completely entrapped within the soft tissue and /or the jawbone are termed "impacted." Wisdom teeth that only partially erupt allows for an opening for bacteria to enter around the tooth and cause an infection, which results in pain, swelling, jaw stiffness, and general illness. Partially erupted teeth are also more prone to tooth decay and gum disease because their hard-to-reach location and awkward positioning makes brushing and flossing difficult.</p>

	<h3>What should I expect after my child has a tooth extracted?</h3>
	<div class="columns">
	<p>Bleeding is typical after a tooth has been extracted. This may last for only about a day.</p>
	<p>A small piece of gauze will be applied to the area of the tooth extraction. This should be kept in place for long enough for the blood to clot. It is important for your child's mouth to be kept as clean as possible during the healing period. This can be done by rinsing the mouth with salt water several times per day.</p>
	<p>If any additional swelling occurs or if your child begins to feel additionally ill or comes down with a fever, then be certain to call Dr. Thiel immediately, in case of infection. This rarely happens though.</p>
	<p>Children's Tylenol or Ibuprofen should be purchased if Dr. Thiel did not already prescribe a painkiller for your child to increase their comfort after the extraction is complete. It is often best if these not be used until the blood clot has formed.</p>
	<p>It may be good to apply a bag of ice to the outside of the child's jaw to keep swelling to a minimum and to aid in numbing the pain.</p>
