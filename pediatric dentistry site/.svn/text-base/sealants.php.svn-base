	<h2>Sealants</h2>
	<p>Sealants protect the grooved and pitted surfaces of the teeth, especially the chewing surfaces of back teeth where most cavities in children are found. Made of clear or shaded plastic, sealants are applied to the teeth to help keep them cavity-free.</p>

	<h3>Will my child need sealants?</h3>
	<div class="columns">
	<p>Even if your child brushes and flosses carefully, it is difficult—sometimes impossible—to clean the tiny grooves and pits on certain teeth. Food and bacteria build up in these crevices, placing your child in danger of tooth decay. Sealants “seal out” food and plaque, thus reducing the risk of decay.</p>

	<h3>How long do sealants last?</h3>
	<div class="columns">
	<p>Research shows that sealants can last for many years if properly cared for. Therefore, your child will be protected throughout the most cavity-prone years. If your child has good oral hygiene and avoids biting hard objects, sealants will last longer. Dr. Thiel will check the sealants during routine dental visits and recommend re-application or repair when necessary.</p>
