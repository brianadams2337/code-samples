				<h2>General Anesthesia</h2>
				<p>General anesthesia is a controlled state of unconsciousness that eliminates awareness, movement, and discomfort during dental treatment. A physician or dentist with specialized training can use various medications to provide general anesthesia for patients receiving dental care.</p>
				<p>This procedure is recommended for very young children or patients that have difficulty cooperating with treatment in the office; an inhalation anesthetic is administered by a medical anesthesiologist in a surgery center or operating room environment and during this procedure all dental treatment, x-rays, and cleanings are provided.</p>

General anesthesia also can be helpful for children requiring significant surgical procedures or patients having special health care needs.</p>
